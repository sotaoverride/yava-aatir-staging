          in service or events, Site access, or access to your account due to circumstances both within our control (e.g.,
          routine maintenance) and outside of our control.</p>
        <h3><a id="modification">5. Modification</a></h3>
        <p>We reserve the right at all times to discontinue or modify any part of these Terms of Use in our sole discretion.

          You agree that posting notice of any changes on the Terms of Use page is adequate notice to advise you of these
          changes, and that your continued use of the Site or our services will constitute acceptance of these changes and
          the Terms of Use as modified.</p>

          of these Terms of Use, including, without limitation, failure to maintain updated and correct information about
          your account (e.g., valid credit card information) will cause your account to fall out of good standing and we
          may cancel your account in our sole discretion. If your account is cancelled, you may forfeit any pending, current,
          or future account credits (e.g., YOVA Bucks), and any other forms of unredeemed value in your account without notice.

          following address: C T Corporation System, 208 S. LaSalle Street, Suite 814, Chicago, IL 60604. Payment of all
          filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. YOVA will reimburse those fees
          for Disputes totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the Dispute is frivolous. Likewise, YOVA
          will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the Dispute is frivolous.
          The arbitration will be conducted based upon written submissions unless you request, and/or the arbitrator determines,
          that a telephone or in-person hearing is necessary. In addition, you hereby unconditionally agree that (1) the
          arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by these Terms of Use and any of the other agreements referenced herein
          that you may have entered into in connection with the Site; (2) the arbitrator shall apply Illinois law consistent
          with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; and
          (3) in the event the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to hear the Dispute, you and the applicable YOVA Entity(ies)
          shall agree to, or a court shall select, another arbitration provider.</p>
        <p><b>(b) <u>No Class Action Matters</u>. We each agree that we shall bring any Dispute against the other in our respective individual capacities and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, representative proceeding or as an association. In addition, we each agree that Disputes shall be arbitrated only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action and that the arbitrator may award relief (including injunctive relief) only on an individual basis. The arbitrator does not have the power to vary these provisions.</b></p>
        <p><b>(c) <u>Choice of Law and Forum; No Jury Trial</u></b>. If for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court: (i) except
          with respect to a qualifying claim over a Dispute in a small claims court, which you shall have the right to bring
          in a court of competent jurisdiction in the county in which you reside, you and YOVA agree that any Dispute may
          only be instituted in a state or federal court in Cook County, Illinois/Northern District of Illinois; (ii) you
          and YOVA irrevocably consent and submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for resolution
          of such Disputes; and (iii) you and YOVA agree to waive any right to a trial by jury. You and YOVA agree that the
          Federal Arbitration Act, the AAA rules, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of Illinois, without
          regard to principles of conflicts of law, will govern this Dispute Agreement and any Disputes.</p>
        <p><b>(d) <u>Injunctive Relief</u></b>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Dispute Agreement, either party
          may bring suit in court seeking an injunction or other equitable relief arising out of or relating to the infringement
          of a party’s intellectual property, or any illegal or intentional act affecting the accessibility, functionality,
          or the security of the Site, and/or any illegal or intentional act against your interests or the general business
          interests of YOVA.</p>
        <p><b>(e) <u>Severability</u></b>. With the exception of Section 24(b) above, if any part of this Section 24 is ruled
          to be unenforceable, then the balance of this Section 24 shall remain in full effect and construed and enforced
          as if the portion ruled unenforceable were not contained herein. If Section 24(b) above is ruled to be unenforceable,
          then Section 24(a) shall be deemed unenforceable, but the rest of Section 24 shall remain in full effect.</p>
